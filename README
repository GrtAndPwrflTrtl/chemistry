To run:

   ./synth <linker-files> <rigid-files> -v <validation-file> -o <output-file> -tc <real-value>

*  rigid files must be prefixed with r and linkers with l .
*  -tc is Tanimoto coefficient [0, 1] where usually 0.95 is accepted as a strong enough coefficient. Default value is 0.95.


Files:

Molecule.cpp : main molecule class implementation. This includes the functions to combine two molecules together.

A molecule consists of atoms (Atom.*) and bonds (Bond.*)

AtomT : parsing and representation of the specific type for an atom: <atom>.<atom-type>

Instantiator.* : Main routine for creating all combinations of molecules and adding to the hypergraph.

Linker.* : parsing and representation of linkers. Note, linkers are molecules in the hypergraph, but are NOT output as combined molecules.

Rigid.cpp : parsing and representation of rigids. Rigids are molecules in the hypergraph, but are NOT output as combined molecules. 


obgen.* : Borrowed code from the obgen application. Provides an interface for us in this application.

OBWriter.* : Outputs the synthesized molecules to the given output file.


Unused currently, but necessary to acquire paths by which molecules are created:

HyperEdgeMultiMap.h
EdgeAggregator.h
EdgeAnnotation.h
